# Basic food week application

Incomplete

Project initialised with Expo, using Google Firebase, react-native-elements, @react-native-picker/picker and @react-navigation/drawer. 

## Basic functions

The app saves recipes to a Firebase Realtime db, from where the user can then select a single recipe to view, or alternatively, create and then view a full week menu for the family in one go (using an Elements Cards component).

## Functions that didn't make it. 

A shopping list function that generates a weekly shopping list from the selected recipes. 

## What would have been nice

More developed UI and potentially, server side intelligence to maintain a more sophisticated week menu system that would reduce food waste by keeping track of portion sizes.
